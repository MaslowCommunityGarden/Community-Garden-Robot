The community garden robot handles pull requests on community projects. It can do a few things.

# Merge pull requests

The robot provides an automatic system for merging pull requests. When a pull request is created the robot will call a community vote to decide if it should be merged. Votes are cast by using the thumbs up and thumbs down indicators on the comment. If the vote is approved the pull request will be merged automatically. Votes are tallied after 48 hours.

# Delete projects

The community garden robot can also delete projects which the community no longer wants in the garden. To delete a project the word delete simply needs to be added to the ROBOT.md file. This can be done using the regular pull request and vote process allowing the community to vote on if the project should be deleted.
